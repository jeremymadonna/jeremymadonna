# Jeremy Madonna

## About Me

**Turning complex data into stories that drive decisions**

I'm that data enthusiast who gets genuinely excited about finding patterns others miss. With a unique background teaching advanced data science and computer science to postgraduate students, I've mastered the art of making complex technical concepts accessible and actionable.

Recently completed **Business Analytics** at Conestoga College (August 2025) and now exploring opportunities to build AI-powered solutions that don't just work—they transform how teams operate.

**Note:** I taught Data Visualization and Python to postgraduate students before becoming a student again. Talk about full circle!
